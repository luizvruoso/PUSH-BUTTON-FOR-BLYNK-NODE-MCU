In this project was implemented a push button with NODE MCU ESP8266 and BLYNK APP.

#SOFTWARE

-> ARDUINO'S IDE <br>
-> BLYNK PLUGIN FOR NODE MCU <br>

The based code is avaliable on Arduino's IDE, with the NODE MCU plugin for Blynk. The greatest adaptation is on when the card is rebooted. 
Before it started and switched on the button, now it starts with the button off. There is notification for when it is activated.

#HARDWARE
